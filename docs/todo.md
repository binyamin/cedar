- [ ] Write tests (with `ava`)
- [x] Minify CSS (with `postcss`, support adding plugins)
- [ ] Process JSX, SSR _and_ normal (with `preact`)
    - [ ] Imported CSS as separate file?
- [x] Fix linting errors (from `xo`)
- [ ] feature: supply a single file as input
- [x] external sourcemaps for CSS and JS
- [ ] support css-in-js (problem is, how to add a file mid-pipeline)
